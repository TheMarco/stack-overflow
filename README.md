## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Phaser 3** - Game framework
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **WebGL** - Hardware-accelerated rendering and custom shaders
- **Canvas API** - Backdrop generation and color extraction

### Architecture
- **Scene-Based Structure** - Modular game scenes (Preload, Mode Select, Game)
- **Custom Shaders** - GLSL fragment shaders for CRT effects
- **Color Extraction System** - Automatic palette generation from backdrop images
- **Sprite Rendering Pipeline** - Dynamic block colorization and rendering
- **Procedural Sound Effects** - Real-time sound effect generation

### Performance
- 60 FPS target frame rate
- Optimized WebGL rendering
- Efficient sprite batching
- Minimal memory footprint

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Levels
1. Create a new backdrop image (256x224 pixels)
2. Place it in `public/assets/backdrops/level-X/backdrop.png`
3. Add corresponding music track in `public/assets/music/level-X/track.mp3`
4. Update `MAX_LEVEL` in `src/constants.js`

See `BACKDROP-GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions on creating backdrops.

### Adjusting CRT Effects
Edit `src/shaderOverlay.js` to customize:
- Curvature intensity
- Scanline density
- Static grain size and intensity
- Flicker frequency and amplitude
- Vignette strength

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Piece Movement
- Pieces fall automatically based on level speed
- Wall kicks allow rotation near edges
- Floor kicks prevent unfair lockouts
- Smooth movement with keyboard repeat

### Level Progression
- Levels 1-10 with exponentially increasing speed
- New backdrop and music for each level
- Visual transition effects between levels
- Speed ranges from 1000ms (Level 1) to 100ms (Level 10)

### Line Clearing
- Standard Tetris line clear mechanics
- Animated crush effect for cleared lines
- Combo system rewards consecutive clears
- Perfect clear detection and bonus
